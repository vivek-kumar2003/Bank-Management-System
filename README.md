# Bank-Management-System

The Bank Account Management System project is a model Internet Banking Site that enables customers to perform basic banking transactions from their office or home using a PC or laptop. This system provides customers with the ability to create an account, deposit or withdraw cash, and view reports of all accounts. Customers can access the bank's website to view their account details and perform transactions as needed. With Internet Banking, the traditional brick-and-mortar banking structure is transformed into a click-and-portal model, giving virtual banking a real shape. This means that modern banking is no longer confined to physical branches, as e-banking allows customers to perform transactions round the clock, globally.

The primary aim of this Bank Account Management System is to provide an improved design methodology that allows for future expansion and modification, which is essential for a core sector like banking. The design is expandable and modifiable, using a modular approach to develop the application software.
Anyone who holds an account in this bank can become a member of the Bank Account Management System. They need to fill out a form with their personal details and account number. A bank is a place where customers feel safe with their property, depositing and withdrawing their money, and conducting money transactions. To maintain customer trust and confidence, efficient bank management is crucial. Effective management positively impacts customer and staff satisfaction and supports the management committee in making necessary decisions for future bank enhancements.

Managing a bank has become increasingly complex, necessitating software that reduces workload and enhances efficiency. In today's fast-paced, computer-driven world, such software is essential for smooth and efficient bank management.
All transactions are carried out online, either between accounts within the same bank or with international banks. This software addresses and overcomes the drawbacks of the manual banking system, ensuring more efficient and reliable banking operations.
